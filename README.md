# Sign Language Alphabet Translation Through Image Classification
## Abstract

For members of the hearing-impaired community, sign language serves as a communication tool for them to communicate with other people. People may find it tough and challenging to understand sign language due to their lack of sign language understanding, and this could be one of the barriers to communicating with the people who are using sign language. In this study, the effectiveness of three different deep learning models for image classification on sign language alphabet translation will be assessed. The three deep learning models that will be utilized and contrasted in this study are ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and VGG16.

## 1. Introduction

The majority of people who classify as "deaf" have severe hearing loss. They will encounter several problems in their daily lives, such as communication problems. Therefore, they frequently communicate by using sign language to convey their ideas. Besides, sign language may be useful for communication for those with difficulties, including Autism, Apraxia of speech, Cerebral Palsy, and Down syndrome. ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and VGG16 are three deep learning image classification models that will be employed in this project. The proposed project is significant because it could be helpful in providing alphabet hand signs translations for those who are not knowledgeable in sign language. Additionally, sign language is essential for persons who struggle with hearing and speech since it allows for voiceless communication.

## 3. Approach

3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing
The project begins by collecting a dataset of sign language alphabet images, with a focus on the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet. This dataset is sourced from Kaggle, comprising 24 classes (excluding 'J' and 'Z'). Data preprocessing steps include noise reduction using median filtering, lighting correction to enhance image quality, and sharpening to highlight image features. Images are also standardized in terms of size and converted to grayscale to facilitate model training.

3.2 Model Selection
Three deep learning models are chosen for this project:

ResNet50: A 50-layer deep convolutional neural network known for its depth and parameter efficiency.
MobileNetV2: An efficient architecture designed for on-device image classification and object detection, particularly suitable for mobile and embedded devices.
VGG16: A model with 16 layers known for its strong performance in image classification tasks.
3.3 Hyperparameter Tuning
To optimize model performance, hyperparameter tuning is performed using the Keras Tuner library. Key hyperparameters such as learning rates and the number of units in the first dense layer are fine-tuned.

3.4 Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics
The performance of the models is evaluated using various metrics, including precision, recall, and the F1-score. These metrics help gauge the model's accuracy in classifying ASL hand signs. Additionally, training and validation accuracy and loss are visualized through graphs.

## 4. Experiment

This section provides a detailed account of the experiments conducted in the project:

The dataset used comprises 24,000 training images, with 2,400 images each in the validation and testing sets.
Visual comparisons are presented before and after applying median filtering, low light enhancement, and sharpening techniques.
Testing accuracy and loss results are tabulated and compared for the three models: VGG16, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2.
Training and validation accuracy and loss graphs are displayed, helping to understand the model's learning process.
Grad-CAM visualizations are utilized to gain insight into where the models focus their attention on input images.

## 5. Conclusion

In this study, we embarked on a journey to address the communication challenges faced by the hearing-impaired community and those with communication difficulties through the lens of sign language translation. We harnessed the power of deep learning models, including ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and VGG16, to evaluate their effectiveness in translating sign language alphabets. The significance of this research lies in its potential to bridge the gap between those with sign language proficiency and those without, promoting effective communication and understanding.

Our exploration into the realm of sign language image classification revealed promising insights:

The chosen deep learning models, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and VGG16, exhibited their capability to learn and recognize sign language alphabets.
Data preprocessing techniques, including noise reduction, lighting correction, and sharpening, played a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of input images and thereby improving model performance.
Hyperparameter tuning allowed us to fine-tune the models for optimal accuracy.
Evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and visual representations of training and validation accuracy and loss, provided valuable insights into the models' capabilities and training processes.
Among the models, ResNet50 stood out as a consistent performer, boasting a remarkable testing accuracy of 95%. Its attention-mapping capabilities, as visualized through Grad-CAM, demonstrated a more precise focus on the hands, a key region in sign language communication.

In conclusion, this study reinforces the potential of deep learning models as valuable tools in facilitating sign language translation and enhancing communication for the hearing-impaired and those facing communication challenges. While we achieved promising results, there is room for further refinement and exploration, including expanding the dataset, exploring additional data augmentation techniques, and considering real-time applications. Sign language is a vital means of communication, and this research underscores the importance of leveraging technology to make it more accessible and comprehensible for all.
